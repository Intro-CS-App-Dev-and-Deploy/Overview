# Overview
Vertical Teaming of High School CS Courses

Two Mandatory Pieces of a Computer Environment
- Creating and Maintaining a GitHub Account
  - External Documentation for a Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository#general-introduction-to-creating-a-github-repository-and-readmemd-file-1">Click Here</a>
  - Using Markdown, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">Click Here</a>
  - Ideas for creating a presentation or video, <a herf="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Introductory%20Presentation%20Guidance"></a>
- Creating and Maintaining a LinkedIn Account, connecting to others (must be at least 16 years old), see the website and start a profile (students will focus on )

Assignments: introduce GitHub, version control software (and file pathways for prototyping), integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")
1. Create a LinkedIn Account and share with Mr. Mercer and others in the class as profile is developed
2. Create a new repository, share it with Mr. Mercer by email (email URL), and modify the ReadMe.md file with Case Study ideas
   - OPTION: use GitHub Classroom

### Preamble Notes

Review Questions utilize Alberta Education's *Diploma Guiding Words*

Note about Pathways and URL's (Internet HTTP & HTTPS): all students will become familiar with ways of noting "Where does my file live?"
- **Reading Hint**: notice the difference between `/` & `\`
- Pathway Exemplar: `C:\Users\mmercer\Documents\GitHub\Hello-World\exemplarHelloWorld`
- URL Exemplar: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Hello-World
- Instructions: File / Save

## Introductory CS Progressions and Assignments

Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs (desktop to cloud)
- Where are GitHub Servers? Which countries and locations?
- How far does data travel with every saving of code?
- What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home? (permissions and physical data updating)

### All Case Studies

Main Project, review what is possible with Ketai.org
- GUI
- List Behaviors and expectations
- List data you will need to code
- What will your touch screen and physical buttons be doing
- List the other interactions this app will have and when these will be available (clean & minimal GUI)

Note for assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"

Additional Case Studies
- *Choose 5 or 6 Case Studies to share in paper through Google Classroom but then also uploaded to repository, once made and shared*

### Websites

### Computer Apps

Using Processing-JAVA, Hello World, <a href="">Create this Example Code, starter and exemplar</a>
- Introduction to
- getting to know the console with print("\n") and println()
- introductions to primitive variables, and simple counting formulae (i.e. x+1 to x++ to x+=1)
- "Additions: what else would you put on in the console to tell the world using \t and other character escapes"\
- See Algorithms Repository

Note for assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"

# To Include

Review Google Drive for coding examples and other ideas

How does AP Work into this?

Introductory
- Coding as if writing "an essay"
- Introduction to static prototyping and dynamic visual data
  - JAVA Compiler requites folder & main program naming, setup(), draw()
  - introduction to empty draw(), loop() & noLoop() in prototyping
- Introduction to flat vs. subprograms
- Geometry as numeracy & key variables: size() and fullScreen() width, height, displayWidth, & displayHeight
  - key variables are red in the IDE when spelt correctly
- 2D Primitive: parameters, variables, place of initiation (global vs. local), and place of population or first value (!null)
- Importance of rect(): page divisions, button area, text area, image area, mouseClicked() areas as mouseX & mouseY
-
- empty draw()
- empty IF to skip code
- single IF
- IF Else
- If elseif else
- nested IF

Arrays as alphanumeric variables
- debugging array index out of bounds (see Previous & Next Buttons in Music Project)

How do more advanced courses add to this?
- CS20
  Creating procedures, even for single lines
  Creating procedures: grouping lines of code
  Autotext algorithms, etc.

Note: With FOR Population after music player in arrays & two types of IF, more complicated code can be written
