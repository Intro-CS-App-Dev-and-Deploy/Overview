# To Include

Review Google Drive for coding examples and other ideas

How does AP Work into this?

Introductory
- Coding as if writing "an essay"
- Introduction to static prototyping and dynamic visual data
  - JAVA Compiler requites folder & main program naming, setup(), draw()
  - introduction to empty draw(), loop() & noLoop() in prototyping
- Introduction to flat vs. subprograms
- Geometry as numeracy & key variables: size() and fullScreen() width, height, displayWidth, & displayHeight
  - key variables are red in the IDE when spelt correctly
- 2D Primitive: parameters, variables, place of initiation (global vs. local), and place of population or first value (!null)
- Importance of rect(): page divisions, button area, text area, image area, mouseClicked() areas as mouseX & mouseY
-
- empty draw()
- empty IF to skip code
- single IF
- IF Else
- If elseif else
- nested IF

Arrays as alphanumeric variables
- debugging array index out of bounds (see Previous & Next Buttons in Music Project)

How do more advanced courses add to this?
- CS20
  Creating procedures, even for single lines
  Creating procedures: grouping lines of code
  Autotext algorithms, etc.

Note: With FOR Population after music player in arrays & two types of IF, more complicated code can be written
