# Overview
Vertical Teaming of High School CS Courses

Four Mandatory Pieces of a Computer Environment
- Creating and Maintaining a GitHub Account
  - External Documentation for a Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository#general-introduction-to-creating-a-github-repository-and-readmemd-file-1">Click Here</a>
  - Using Markdown, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">Click Here</a>
  - Ideas for creating a presentation or video, <a herf="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Introductory%20Presentation%20Guidance"></a>
- Creating and Maintaining a LinkedIn Account, connecting to others (must be at least 16 years old), see the website and start a profile (students will focus on )
- Downloading and Inflating Processing on the parent folder of the C-Drive (Mr. Mercer will help with this)
  - Here: https://processing.org/
- Downloading and Installing Atom.io, here, https://atom.io/

Assignments: introduce GitHub, version control software (and file pathways for prototyping), integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")
1. Create a LinkedIn Account and share with Mr. Mercer and others in the class as profile is developed
2. Create a new repository, share it with Mr. Mercer by email (email URL), and modify the ReadMe.md file with Case Study ideas
   - OPTION: use GitHub Classroom
3. Create new repositories for each of the Case Studies listed below
   - Introductory CS: <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Overview#introductory-cs-case-studies">here</a>)
   - Intermediate CS
   - Advanced CS

### Preamble Notes

Review Questions utilize Alberta Education's *Diploma Guiding Words*

Note about Pathways and URL's (Internet HTTP & HTTPS): all students will become familiar with ways of noting "Where does my file live?"
- **Reading Hint**: notice the difference between `/` & `\`
- Pathway Exemplar: `C:\Users\mmercer\Documents\GitHub\Hello-World\exemplarHelloWorld`
- URL Exemplar: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Hello-World
- Instructions: File / Save

---

## Introductory CS Progressions and Assignments

Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs (desktop to cloud)
- Where are GitHub Servers? Which countries and locations?
- How far does data travel with every saving of code?
- What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home? (permissions and physical data updating)

### Introductory CS Case Studies

*IMPORTANT*: You should have 9 repositories started in GitHub & GitHub Desktop

Main Project, review what is possible with Ketai.org
- GUI
- List Behaviors and expectations
- List data you will need to code
- What will your touch screen and physical buttons be doing
- List the other interactions this app will have and when these will be available (clean & minimal GUI)

Website Case Studies ("How do you convince another person, by reading a single page, your digital identity or app created is worth reading or using further?")
- "Who Am I" Website Project
- Promotion of Android App: Drawing Program or Music Program

Note for Android Assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"

Additional Case Studies (what users will see in an example )
- *Note about submitting Case Studies*:
  - submit an image of paper and save this into the Repository made for the Project
  - export file from program, to be saved in Repository (i.e. MS Paint's .bitmap)
- Any additional notes you have should be entered into the ReadMe.md file through Atom.io using <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">GitHub Markdown</a>
1. Hello World & Simple Counting (using formulae)
2. Composite Images (Snow Globe, Measles, etc.)
3. 3 by 3 Assignment including random colour with additional text, and images
4. Drawing Program (including background song and sound effects using mouse)
5. Music Program (including sound effects using key board and mouse)
6. Final Project: using Ketai Library

### Websites

### Computer Apps

Using Processing-JAVA, Hello World, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Hello-World">Create this Example Code, starter and exemplar</a>
- Introduction to Processing-IDE
- getting to know the console with print("\n") and println()
- introductions to primitive variables, and simple counting formulae (i.e. x+1 to x++ to x+=1)
- "Additions: what else would you put on in the console to tell the world using \t and other character escapes"\
- See Algorithms Repository

---

Note for all future assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"

# To Include

Review Google Drive for coding examples and other ideas

How does AP Work into this?

Introductory
- Coding as if writing "an essay"
- Introduction to static prototyping and dynamic visual data
  - JAVA Compiler requites folder & main program naming, setup(), draw()
  - introduction to empty draw(), loop() & noLoop() in prototyping
- Introduction to flat vs. subprograms
- Geometry as numeracy & key variables: size() and fullScreen() width, height, displayWidth, & displayHeight
  - key variables are red in the IDE when spelt correctly
- 2D Primitive: parameters, variables, place of initiation (global vs. local), and place of population or first value (!null)
- Importance of rect(): page divisions, button area, text area, image area, mouseClicked() areas as mouseX & mouseY
-
- empty draw()
- empty IF to skip code
- single IF
- IF Else
- If elseif else
- nested IF

Arrays as alphanumeric variables
- debugging array index out of bounds (see Previous & Next Buttons in Music Project)

How do more advanced courses add to this?
- CS20
  Creating procedures, even for single lines
  Creating procedures: grouping lines of code
  Autotext algorithms, etc.

Note: With FOR Population after music player in arrays & two types of IF, more complicated code can be written
