# Overview
Vertical Teaming of Online High School CS Courses for Android Development

Five Mandatory Pieces of a Computer Environment for Android Apps
- Creating and Maintaining a GitHub Account
  - External Documentation for a Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository#general-introduction-to-creating-a-github-repository-and-readmemd-file-1">Click Here</a>
  - Using Markdown, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">Click Here</a>
  - Ideas for creating a presentation or video, <a herf="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Introductory%20Presentation%20Guidance"></a>
- Creating and Maintaining a LinkedIn Account, connecting to others (must be at least 16 years old), see the website and start a profile (students will focus on )
- Downloading and Inflating Processing on the parent folder of the C-Drive (Mr. Mercer will help with this)
  - Here: https://processing.org/
- Downloading and Installing Atom.io, here, https://atom.io/
- Downloading and Installing GitHub Desktop (i.e. version control software), https://desktop.github.com/

Assignments: introduce GitHub, version control software (and file pathways for prototyping), integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")
1. Create a LinkedIn Account and share with Mr. Mercer and others in the class as profile is developed
2. Create a new repository, share it with Mr. Mercer by email (email URL), and modify the ReadMe.md file with Case Study ideas
   - OPTION: use GitHub Classroom
   - NOTE: you should take some time and explore GitHub Classroom (lots of free stuff to explore)
3. Create new repositories for each of the Case Studies listed below
   - Introductory CS: <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Overview#introductory-cs-case-studies">here</a>)
   - Intermediate CS
   - Advanced CS

What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controlled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

### Preamble Notes

Review Questions utilize Alberta Education's *Diploma Guiding Words*

Note about Pathways and URL's (Internet HTTP & HTTPS): all students will become familiar with ways of noting "Where does my file live?"
- **Reading Hint**: notice the difference between `/` & `\`
- Pathway Exemplar: `C:\Users\mmercer\Documents\GitHub\Hello-World\exemplarHelloWorld`
- URL Exemplar: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Hello-World
- Instructions: File / Save

---

## Introductory CS Progressions and Assignments

Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs (desktop to cloud)
- Where are GitHub Servers? Which countries and locations?
- How far does data travel with every saving of code?
- What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home? (permissions and physical data updating)

### Introductory CS Case Studies

*IMPORTANT*: You should have 9 repositories started in GitHub & GitHub Desktop

Main Project, Android App, review what is possible with Ketai.org
- "Design a cell phone app for your main project" that will first run as a fullScreen() computer app
- GUI
- List Behaviors and expectations
- List data you will need to code
- What will your touch screen and physical buttons be doing
- List the other interactions this app will have and when these will be available (clean & minimal GUI)

Website Case Studies ("How do you convince another person, by reading a single page, your digital identity or app created is worth reading or using further?")
- "Who Am I" Website Project
- Promotion of Android App: Drawing Program or Music Program

Note for Android Assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"

Additional Case Studies (what users will see in an example )
- *Note about submitting Case Studies*:
  - submit an image of paper and save this into the Repository made for the Project
  - export file from program, to be saved in Repository (i.e. MS Paint's .bitmap)
- Any additional notes you have should be entered into the ReadMe.md file through Atom.io using <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">GitHub Markdown</a>
1. Hello World & Simple Counting (using formulae)
2. Composite Images (Snow Globe, Measles, etc.)
3. 3 by 3 Assignment including random colour with additional text, and images
4. Drawing Program (including background song and sound effects using mouse)
5. Music Program (including sound effects using key board and mouse)
6. Final Project: using Ketai Library

### Computer Apps

**Note**: assignments start with Flat and Static Programs, progressing to dynamic and introducing Intermediate CS (non-flat)

Using Processing-JAVA, **Hello World**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Hello-World">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- Introduction to Processing-IDE
- getting to know the console with print("\n") and println()
- introductions to primitive variables, and simple counting formulae (i.e. x+1 to x++ to x+=1)
- "Additions: what else would you put on in the console to tell the world using \t and other character escapes"\
- See Algorithms Repository

**Drawing a Rectangle**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Drawing-a-Rectangle">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- Purpose: using rect() parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading to advanced Geometry Ratios, buttons, text, and images code
- Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- CAUTION: might start with pixel numbers related to size() as if on a modified coordinate plane, BUT, ratios are better (see paperfolding lesson by Mr. Mercer)
  - similar to DIV's in website design
- Introduce separation of initiating & populating variables
- Introduce `color` variable, hexadecimal, RGB Notation, random feature with inequality boundary, and IDE Color Sector
  - IDE Color Selector: Tools / Color Selector
- See Processing.org for additional parameters like opacity
- Note about learning the hard way: video explores typing and reading in code, what different parameters to, and curiosity in prototyping a section of code
- Note about primitive-version-control: these are "snapshots" of what coding a prototype might look like

**Drawing Text**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Rect-Application-Text">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- Purpose: using rect() parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading to advanced Geometry Ratios, buttons, text, and images code
- Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- Illustrates:
  - Visualizing where text will be located with a rectangle
  - Choosing a font and size
  - Choosing ink
  - Simple Typography choices (see Processing.org / Reference / Search Typography for other choices)
  - Debugging "white space" inside the font to choose a font size based on Display Geometry
- Develops `String` Variable
- Develops `rect() parameters` as copy-paste parameters in other Functions
- Advanced Ideas
  - Text Input: key-variable, char, String Variable, & Concatenation
  - Libraries with automatic text input fields

**Drawing an Image**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Rect-Application-Image">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- Purpose: using rect() parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading to advanced Geometry Ratios, buttons, text, and images code
- Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- Illustrates:
  - Visualizing where an image will be located with a rectangle
  - Inspecting an image's geometry for aspect ratio
  - Arithmetic for aspect ratio
  - Catching Canvas errors when entire image will not display because display geometry is too small
- Other exemplars demonstrate multiple images being displayed
  - When is a display too small?
  - Tracking variable names with alphanumeric system
  - Introduction to arrays (further explored in Intermediate CS)
- Big Idea: how to create a collage.
- Advanced Concept: night mode in RGB Colors
- See Processing.org Tutorials for a *Scary Image* Project

**Composite Shapes**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Composite-Shapes">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- In Junior High Math Class, composite shapes describe combinations of 2D Primitive Shapes, which is the same in 8-bit GUI Design
- Purpose: Learn parameters can be formulae based on geometry ratios or other variables
  - using `rect()` parameters as variables in "divisions of page" metaphor leading variables for an inscribed circle (mimics Google's Clean &  Minimalist design of hover-over circles in Chrome)
  - start with `rect()` to layout where other 2D Primitives will be located
  - see prototyped example of `rect()` with inscribed circle ( ellipse() ): `Prototyping 2D Primitives`
- Example Project Metaphors:
  - Snow Globe
  - Measles or Happy Face (See Flat Measles Exemplar)
  - Others ... talk with Mr. Mercer
- Exemplar is static and flat (comments will point toward dynamic sections)
- Dynamic Exemplar points towards creating a button with `mouseClicked()`

**Note**: assignments are now dynamic and are modified flat, eventually it will be easier to use subprograms (TABS in Processing-JAVA IDE)

**Creating Buttons and Mouse Interactions**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Rect-Application-Quit-Button">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- Prototype a button as a rectangle
- Prototype a Quit Button (as a subprogram for introduction to dynamic non-flat programs, copying code to any program)

**3 x 3 Home Screen**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/3x3-Home-Screen">Create this Example, starter and exemplar</a>
- Getting Started with 1 or two buttons: create 2 projects emphasizing single-line-IF, Boolean, and IF-Else
  - Version 1 of Do This Not That: Two Buttons and the surrounding space
  - Version 2 of Do This Not That: A single Button with similar behaviours as v1
- Repeating and tracking the Mouse-Click-Boolean-Draw() sequence: create a program illustrating how 9 different buttons interact with each other using different shapes, texts, and images

Note: this is the final assignment or project before the "Final Exam" Projects

**Drawing Program, Final Exam Project**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/App-Development">Click Here for Information, starter codes, examples, and additional help</a>
- Finish Interactive Drawing Program
- Include
  - Labeled Sections of Drawing Program to simulate simple instructions
  - Rectangle that functions as a canvas, where art happens
  - Drawing Tool (simple drawing tools have different brush sizes and colours, more advanced drawing tools change way ink is applied)
  - Erasing Tool (actually optical illusion since draws in the ink of the background)
  - 2D Shapes, colours, and text are all included above, images are not.
    - Students are responsible for Images
    - [OPTIONAL] Image as a background so interaction is like a colouring book
  - [Minimum Expectation] Add an additional button to include play-pause-rewind of single background song
  - [Minimum Expectation] Add a sound effect to all buttons on mouse clicked

Mandatory: exporting program in "Full Screen" for ability to share your drawing program with anyone

Finish the Drawing Program, Then the Music Player Program, then return to the Drawing Program and add the music and sound effects

Unique Concepts are illustrated here that repeat all previous lessons
- Virtual Paper is the button to draw
- Virtual Paper is the limit of where the mouse will interact with drawing tools
- Other buttons develop how the mouse interacts with the virtual paper
- More buttons provide context like changing the background simulating a colouring book
- Even more buttons provide a user context, like background music and sound effects

**Music Program, Final Exam Project**, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/App-Development">Click Here for Information, starter codes, examples, and additional help</a>
- Create a Music Player App you might load to your device
- Project introduces a "Library" and research into different non-native Functions
  - Exporting Project in GitHub as "Final Version" ensures library and JDK files retained for independent execution
- Prototyping Minim is used to learn the Music Player Minim Library
  - Prototyping occurs on the keyboard
  - Once Music Player functions are working, these are transferred by students to Mouse Functions
- Exemplar Music Player demonstrates a completed music player, by a student (did not earn over 80%)
- Exemplar MusicPlayer KeyPressed illustrates a completed version of the minimum expectations of the Music Player Library
  - Illustrates example of organizing music and other files in folders, similar to Webpage-Websites organization and Reference
- Include
  - GUI with minimum 7 buttons: play, pause, stop, forward, reverse, loop, next, back, repeat-all-songs, and randomize all songs
    - Note: first 6 buttons will work with only one song
    - Additional buttons will require more than one song
  - Sound effect when a button is clicked
  - Text is printed from any of the Song's meta-data (auto-populating and changing String variables)
  - Images are mandatory but the choice of the student (i.e. artwork from fan pages)

This project also introduces alphanumeric variables and array data.
- Emphasized: array index arithmetic allows for button control and drawing-to-canvas of various songs

Enrichment: multi-media is accessed within files contained in the GitHub Project folder
- Access is very similar to website multi-media

Advanced Enrichment: when more songs are manually added to the "Music Program Folder" a programmed data entry feature allows for array to be automatically changed, instead of relying on a programmer to change code
- Requirement: Intermediate CS Processing-Java Array Functions changing the originally coded data structure
- CAUTION: once the program is ended, this data is lost unless .txt Read-Write data functions are enabled (another Intermediate CS Topic)

**Final Project**, <a href="">Click Here when URL is added</a>
- If you could study anything, what would you build and deploy to an android device?
- Discuss all ideas with Mr. Mercer, including an educated guess about time lines and due dates
- Note: modifying your drawing program or music programs can be a part of this final project

---

# To Include

Review Google Drive for coding examples and other ideas

How does AP Work into this?

Grading Note: changing screen size automatically checks for size() or fullScreen() geometry ratios

Introductory
- Coding as if writing "an essay"
- Introduction to static prototyping and dynamic visual data
  - JAVA Compiler requites folder & main program naming, setup(), draw()
  - introduction to empty draw(), loop() & noLoop() in prototyping
- Introduction to flat vs. subprograms
- Geometry as numeracy & key variables: size() and fullScreen() width, height, displayWidth, & displayHeight
  - key variables are red in the IDE when spelt correctly
- 2D Primitive: parameters, variables, place of initiation (global vs. local), and place of population or first value (!null)
- Importance of rect(): page divisions, button area, text area, image area, mouseClicked() areas as mouseX & mouseY
-
- empty draw()
- empty IF to skip code
- single IF
- IF Else
- If elseif else
- nested IF

Arrays as alphanumeric variables
- debugging array index out of bounds (see Previous & Next Buttons in Music Project)

How do more advanced courses add to this?
- CS20
  Creating procedures, even for single lines
  Creating procedures: grouping lines of code
  Autotext algorithms, etc.

Note: With FOR Population after music player in arrays & two types of IF, more complicated code can be written
